ReactJS + Spring Boot CRUD Application

Project Overview:
Welcome to the ReactJS + Spring Boot CRUD App! This is a full-stack web application I developed to manage employee data with complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality. The project is built using ReactJS for the front-end and Spring Boot for the back-end, connecting seamlessly through REST APIs. Data is stored in a MySQL database, so everything is persistent and easy to manage.

What the project does:
Imagine you're running a small organization where you need to keep track of employees—this app does exactly that! It allows you to add new employees, view employee details, edit existing employee information, and delete employees. It's a simple and efficient way to manage employee records, designed to be easy to use and maintain.

How it works:
The front-end is built with ReactJS, which ensures a smooth and dynamic user experience. I've also used Bootstrap 4 to give it a clean and responsive look. The back-end runs on Spring Boot, which handles all the heavy lifting—processing data, connecting to the MySQL database, and ensuring everything works as it should.

Each part of the app has been carefully crafted:

Create and update employees with a simple form.
List all employees in a neat table, with options to edit or delete each entry.
RESTful APIs ensure that the front-end and back-end communicate effectively.
Why this project matters:
This project isn’t just about managing data; it’s a great example of how a front-end (ReactJS) and back-end (Spring Boot) can work together in harmony. It showcases how you can build robust, real-world applications that scale well and are easy to maintain. Plus, it's a great foundation for learning about connecting front-end interfaces with back-end APIs!

Tech stack:

ReactJS for the front-end interface.
Spring Boot for the back-end services.
MySQL for data storage.
Bootstrap 4 for responsive design.
JPA for handling database interactions.
Development Journey:
I started by setting up the Spring Boot project and configuring the MySQL database. From there, I created the RESTful APIs to handle all the CRUD operations. Then came the front-end, where I built React components to display and manage employee data, with everything tied together using API calls. As the project grew, I added routing, a clean layout with header and footer components, and styled everything to look professional.

What I learned:
This project helped me dive deeper into full-stack development, teaching me how to effectively integrate front-end and back-end systems. I also gained experience in API design, database management, and creating reusable front-end components.
